# prototype-comida-cookbook
Comida is the temporary devepolment name for a cookbook recipe database. The goal is to create a way to create, share, and read recipes intuitively for mobile devices while making it easy to try to cook new things. Recipes store steps in individual step cards that track the ingredients, how many, cook time, and what tools you'll need to cook.
