# Prototype Comida Cookbook
Comida is the temporary devepolment name for a cookbook recipe database. The goal is to create a way to create, share, and read recipes intuitively for mobile devices while making it easy to try to cook new things. Recipes store steps in individual step cards that track the ingredients, how many, cook time, and what tools you'll need to cook.

# What is this repo?
For our data systems class we have to design a database application as part of a year long project. This repo is where we will develop this system and hopefully be able to transfer everything we've learned to a more fulfledged system with more features and one that can one work on mobile devices.

# Tech Stack
It will be a web application that utilizes an SQL database to store all the information for the recipes.
